                <p>Welcome to AgentAI. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the AgentAI website and any services, content, and products made available through it (collectively, the "Service").</p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

                <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>AgentAI provides a platform that connects **AI Automation Agencies and Consulting Firms ("Partners")** with qualified leads in the real estate sector. AgentAI is solely a lead generation service. We do not provide automation services, nor do we guarantee the closing or success of any lead provided to the Partner.</p>

                <h2>3. Partner Eligibility and Conduct</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Eligibility:** Partners must be legally registered entities or consultants capable of entering into binding contracts.</li>
                    <li>**Accuracy of Information:** Partners agree to provide current, complete, and accurate information when submitting partnership inquiries via the lead capture form.</li>
                    <li>**Prohibited Use:** You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in any way that violates these Terms or the rights of others.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Lead Guarantee and Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>AgentAI strives to provide high-quality, pre-qualified leads. However, the following limitations apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**No Success Guarantee:** AgentAI makes no warranties regarding the outcome of leads, including the conversion rate, closing rate, or quality of the lead's final business.</li>
                    <li>**Payment Structure:** Fees for leads or exclusive territories will be governed by a separate, formal Partnership Agreement executed offline. These website Terms cover site usage only.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of AgentAI.</p>

                <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>In no event shall AgentAI, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory.</p>

                <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                
                <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
